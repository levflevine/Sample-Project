# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview of the Project

The goal of the project is to discover and document bacterial species that have ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. The Research Lab has partners with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species in an attempt to find bacteria that can provide the perfect taste. The working hypothesis is that the needed microorganism can be found from bacteria found on a human body, specifically in belly buttons. To validate the hypothesis, the Lab has tested a sample of people to identify bacterial species that colonize the belly buttons. The dashboard below provides the summary of the research materials.
